**8TH EDITION**
The goal of this guide is to provide the reader with a concise, yet complete, courseware which will
provide the reader with the required level of knowledge for the Amateur Radio Basic Qualification
certificate. The 8th Edition, like its predecessors, is the only Canadian training manual to include a
detailed summary and interpretation of the rules and regulations pertaining to the Amateur Radio
Service. In addition to the applicable theory, the section covering operating practices has been expanded
to assist the new ham in obtaining confidence on the air. Innovation, Science and Economic Development
Canada has recently released new exams containing a greater number of block diagrams. The 8th
Edition provides complete coverage of all block diagrams found in the latest exams. This edition also
excludes Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada’s Question Bank, which are now
available online. We welcome you to the world of Amateur Radio and wish you the best of luck.
